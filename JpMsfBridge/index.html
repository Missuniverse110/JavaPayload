<h1>JpMsfBridge - Integrate JavaPayload into Metasploit Framework</h1>

<p><i>&copy; 2012 Michael 'mihi' Schierl, <tt>&lt;schierlm at users dot sourceforge dot net&gt;</tt></i></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This archive provides a way to launch JavaPayload stagers, stages and more directly from
Metasploit framework. It is possible to combine JavaPayload modules with Metasploit modules
in almost all sensible ways (e. g. a Metasploit exploit using a JavaPayload stager to stage)
a Meterpreter stage).</p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>Metasploit Framework and JavaPayload <tt>:-)</tt>. Additional payloads
like J2EEPayload can be integrated if desired.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>First, you will have to use the <i>Generator</i> to generate Metasploit
modules from the JavaPayload modules. Therefore, set up the classpath so that
it contains at least <tt>JavaPayload.jar</tt> and <tt>JpMsfBridge.jar</tt>.
You can add other Jars like <tt>J2EEPayload.jar</tt> if you like. Note that these
Jars have their own dependencies, so to make sure they are found, do not copy the
Jars but instead use them inside the respective distribution. As the generated
Metasploit modules will reference their dependencies with absolute path names,
put both JpMsfBridge and the module jars at a place where they will stay (i. e.
not <tt>/tmp</tt>). You will need an empty modules directory where the modules
should be created, you can create a msf3 directory below the JvMsfBridge directory
or create it anywhere else &ndash; putting the generated modules into the Metasploit
module directory is not recommended. Once you finished setting up your layout, run
the generator (run it in the JpMsfBridge directory so it finds the templates
folder):</p>

<p><tt>java -cp JpMsfBridge.jar;c:\JavaPayload\JavaPayload.jar jpmsfbridge.Generator msf3 C:\Programs\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe</tt></p>

<p>The last parameter tells JpMsfBridge which Java version you want to use for running the payloads inside Metasploit.</p>

<p>Now start up Metasploit and integrate your directory into <tt>MsfModulePaths</tt>:</p>

<p><tt>msf &gt; setg MsfModulePaths c:/JpMsfBridge/msf3</tt></p>

<p>If you have more than one module path to add, separate them by semicolons.</p>

<p>Restart Metasploit Framework and you will notice you have more modules now!</p>

<h2>Module Mapping</h2>

<h3>Naming conventions</h3>

<p>Each module generated from JavaPayload will have a name starting with <tt>javapayload_</tt>.
The rest of the name is similar to the JavaPayload name, only that it is all lowercase and
wherever a capital letter was after a noncapital one, an underscore is added: JSh becomes jsh,
BindTCP becomes bind_tcp, UpExec becomes up_exec etc. Parameter names are like those inside
JavaPayload (they are all uppercase anyway).</p>

<h3>Stages</h3>

<p>All JavaPayload stages are available in Metasploit, as Java stages, like
<tt>java/javapayload_jsh/reverse_tcp</tt>. They are compatible with all
JavaPayload stagers and with the <tt>reverse_tcp</tt> and <tt>bind_tcp</tt>
Metasploit stagers. From the Metasploit perspective, they are like a
Command shell, so there are no advanced features like tab completion
available.</p>

<h3>Stagers</h3>

<p>All JavaPayload stagers that can be started without extra arguments
(an example that requires extra arguments is JDWPTunnel) are available
as stagers in Metasploit. They have a ConnectionType of either
<tt>bind</tt> or <tt>reverse</tt> and be compatible with all exploits
that are compatible with these connection types. Stagers that require
extra arguments use their own connection types, therefore they are
currently not usable from any exploit.</p>

<p>Stagers can be used to generate payload war and jar files, 
to connect to those payload war and jar files via <tt>multi/handler</tt>
and to do both from an exploit.</p>

<h3>Injectors</h3>

<p>Are still to be implemented.</p>

<h3>Dynstagers</h3>

<p>Come later.</p>

<h3>And the rest</h3>

<p>Comes when all the things above are working.</p>
