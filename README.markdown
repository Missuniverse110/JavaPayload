## JavaPayload

JavaPayload is a collection of pure Java payloads to be used for post-exploitation from pure Java exploits or from common misconfigurations (like not password protected Tomcat manager or debugger port).

and inside this repo.

The current home of this project is http://javapayload.sourceforge.net/ and its source is at http://javapayload.svn.sourceforge.net/.

## Get in touch

You can contact me at schierlm@users.sourceforge.net. Or, just fork and send pull requests. I will try my very best to get them merged into SVN (still a git newbie), or may even switch over to GitHub if contributions get overwhelming :-)
